# AlphaZero Light

A compact, scalable implementation of the AlphaZero algorithm, starting from Tic-Tac-Toe and progressing to Chess.

## Goals
- Clean, modular codebase.
- Scalable MCTS with Neural Network integration.
- Comprehensive documentation.
- Interactive UI with Streamlit.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run training (coming soon).
