# AlphaZero Light

A compact, scalable implementation of the AlphaZero algorithm, starting from Tic-Tac-Toe and progressing to Chess.

## Goals
- Clean, modular codebase.
- Scalable MCTS with Neural Network integration.
- Comprehensive documentation.
- Interactive UI with Streamlit.

## Setup
1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate azl
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run training:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_train.py
