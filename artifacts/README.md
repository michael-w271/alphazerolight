# Artifacts

This folder stores generated or archival project outputs that should not live in
the repository root.

- `logs/`: archived runtime and experiment logs.
- `results/`: legacy evaluation outputs.
- `archives/`: packaged exports (for example zip snapshots).
- `runtime/`: runtime state files (for example PID files).
- `binaries/`: compiled helper binaries.
